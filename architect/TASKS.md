# Tasks

## Project Goal
macOS desktop TODO app (Python 3, stdlib only): each list is one Markdown file with GFM checkboxes (text + optional `<!-- Description: -->` line). Tkinter GUI with list sidebar, item rows (toggle/edit/trash), completed-item display filter, modal edit dialog, settings window (theme, completed cap, portable lists dir), persisted settings, auto-save. Headless-safe core (models/storage/settings) for testability.

## Test Policy
- Framework: `pytest`.
- Full suite: `(cd implementer/src && .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -v)` (348 pass, 2 skip, ~26s baseline).
- Targeted: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/<file> -v` from `implementer/src/`.
- Refactor series R1-R8: **test files are frozen** — implementers may not add, modify, or remove any test; every task is verified against the existing suite only.

## Current Implementation Summary
A working macOS TODO application: users create, rename, and delete lists stored as one Markdown file per list; each item is a GFM checkbox with optional text and an HTML-comment description. The GUI provides a list sidebar, per-item toggle/edit/trash rows, and a completed-item display filter; a modal dialog edits text and description together, and double-click opens the same dialog. A settings window offers light/dark/system theme choice (system reacts to macOS appearance changes), a completed-item cap, and an optional portable lists directory; in the dark theme the settings spinbox arrows stay visible in normal, hover, and disabled states, with a clearly contrasting hover fill (B1/B2/B3); it validates directories with clear error messages and persists choices immediately. Settings live in the fixed config dir, independent of the data dir. A themed dock icon is applied when available. The core (models, storage, settings, controller) is headless and importable without a display; `app.py` hosts the Tkinter GUI shell, while its settings window, item rows, theme engine, edit dialog, placeholders, dialog helpers, controller, and visible-items filter now live in dedicated modules. All 348 tests pass.

## Active Task
None. B3 completed, verified, and merged (Implementer commit `4388e2d`). Queue holds only the non-blocking backlog entry.

## Queue
- **Backlog (non-blocking):** `TodoApp` still builds the sidebar (listbox, entries, buttons) and owns the edit-dialog open/save flow in `_build_ui`/`_open_edit_dialog`; extract to dedicated modules if `app.py` grows again.

## Active Blockers
None.

## Recently Completed
- B3 — Spinbox hover contrast: new `spin_hover` palette fill (`#565656` dark / `#d0d0d0` light) mapped to `TSpinbox` active/pressed `background`; hover now clearly visible: DONE (Implementer commit 4388e2d).
- B2 — Spinbox hover: `TSpinbox` state maps pin `-background`/`-arrowcolor` (active/pressed → palette `btn_active`/`fg`, disabled → `fg_disabled`); `btn_active` promoted into `palette_for`: DONE (Implementer commit cb53a91).
- B1 — Dark-theme spinbox arrows: `apply_theme` pins `TSpinbox -arrowcolor` to palette fg (Tk 9 C Arrow element otherwise defaults near-black); new `test_gui_spinbox_arrows.py`: DONE (Implementer commit eb3cd40).
- R9 — Remove both compat shims: `dock_icon_path` canonical in `dialogs.py` + `apply_dock_icon(root, icon_path)` param, `relocate_lists` called directly in controller, authorized 2-line test repatch: DONE (Implementer commit 6d81255).
- R8 — Final complexity pass: no `nonlocal` in controller, row rebuild moved to `item_row.rebuild_rows`, compressed wrappers/slimmed `__init__`; app.py 713 → 589 lines: DONE (Implementer commit bd38aa1).
