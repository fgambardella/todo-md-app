## Project Goal

Build a macOS desktop TODO app in Python with a stdlib-only runtime. Persist each list as a portable Markdown file with GFM checkboxes. Keep domain, persistence, and controller logic headlessly testable beneath the Tkinter GUI, with persistent settings and light/dark themes.

## Test Policy

- Framework: pytest, already used throughout `implementer/src/tests/`.
- Full suite from `implementer/`: `(cd src && .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -v)`.
- Targeted convention from `implementer/`: `(cd src && .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/<file>.py -v)`.
- Tests require `implementer/src/` as working directory for existing relative asset paths; tools may set that workdir directly and run the inner command.
- Build/release changes also require the corresponding gated tests from `implementer/src/`: `RUN_BUILD_TESTS=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_build_script.py -v`; `RUN_RELEASE_TESTS=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_release_package.py -v`.
- GUI tests use isolated data/config directories. Geometry tests map windows on the local display; structural-only label checks keep roots withdrawn before construction-time idle processing. Owned roots are updated and unconditionally destroyed, including failure paths; headless tests never launch the GUI.
- Automated tests must never require human input. Mock expected dialog choices explicitly; unexpected dialogs must fail immediately or at teardown when swallowed by Tk. Shared facilities: `implementer/src/tests/conftest.py`. Negative subprocess tests assert expected inner failures while the outer suite remains green. Never blanket-answer Yes, suppress failures, or add skips/xfails to hide regressions.

## Current Implementation Summary

- Lists persist as separate Markdown files with atomic writes and filesystem-safe names; validated operations persist immediately.
- The GUI supports list creation, item toggles, per-item deletion, placeholder hints, and confirmation of destructive actions. Main-window sizing keeps sidebar controls accessible. Completed items retain completion order above unfinished items, showing only the newest configured count without deleting hidden items.
- Light/dark themes include readable controls and insertion cursors, a theme-aware version badge, and custom dock/Finder icons. Settings theme controls have consistent palette colors and symmetric margins, including during live changes.
- Settings use fully visible, centered Save/Cancel actions, validate and save the full payload, apply theme and completed-item filtering live, and discard unsaved controls on window Cancel. Filtering never changes stored content.
- Directory changes apply live with optional list movement and an explicit confirmation; popup Cancel retains the directory while saving other settings. Populated destinations are accepted, collisions are rejected without overwriting, equivalent paths are harmless, and configuration stays fixed.
- Relocation failures preserve recoverable files and refresh the active view; failed settings persistence keeps the destination usable and supports retry without repeating moves, pending theme/filter edits remain unapplied.
- Automated GUI tests intercept unexpected dialogs and verify cleanup after failures without human interaction.
- Item rows have an edit icon left of the trash; the pre-populated modal persists new text to the `.md` file on Save, while Cancel or empty input is a no-op.
- Build and release scripts produce a launch-tested Apple Silicon app bundle and versioned distributable ZIP.
